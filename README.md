# COVID-App-UI-Tracker-TFLite

This Flutter App, uses an API to get the relevant COVID statistics and also contains a deployed TFLite model trained on COVID and Non-COVID Chest X-rays.


Here are some screenshots:

Please note that the TFLite model is very small and does not make accurate predictions and cannot be used in real world scenarios.
It was more of a deployed practice for me.

I made this app as a part of my contribution to PSoC2020.
